STRING.H WITH ADDITIONS


TYPES

size_t -- used for a count of bytes. It is the result of the sizeof
operator. According to the C language standard, it shall be an unsigned
integer type capable of storing values  in  the  range  [0, SIZE_MAX].
According to POSIX, the implementation shall support one or more
programming environments where the width of size_t is no greater than the
width of the type long.

The length modifier for size_t for the printf and the scanf families of
functions is z; resulting commonly in %zu or %zx for printing size_t values.


MACRO

NULL -- this macro is the value of a null pointer constant.


STRING.H

void *memchr(const void *s, int c, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
The memchr() function scans the initial n bytes of the memory area pointed
to by s for the first instance of c. Both c and the bytes of the memory
area pointed to by s are interpreted as unsigned char.
RETURN VALUE
The memchr() function return a pointer to the matching byte or NULL if the
character does not occur in the given memory area.
